### Preparation

**Pastry Cream**
1. Combine milk, cream, 1/4 cup sugar and salt in a saucepan over medium heat
2. Stir constantly until the sugar is dissolved and mixture comes to a simmer. Remove from heat
3. Whisk egg yolks with remaining sugar until combined. Sprinkle cornstartch over mixture and whisk again until slightly thickened.
4. Drizzle a small amount of the cream mixture over the egg mixture while whisking. Then whisk mixtures together until fully combined.
5. Pour mixture back into the saucepan at medium heat, whisking frequently until thickened to preference. Don't stop whisking or it will become lumpy. Mixture will continue to thicken slightly once cooled.
6. Add the butter and vanilla extract and whisk to combine.
7. Allow to cool before transferring to the tart crust (otherwise the fruit will sink in)

**Tart Crust**

1. Combine all ingredients in a bowl and mix until crumbs form
2. Overmixing melts the butter to form a dough ball. If this occurs, refridgerate until set before next step
3. Roll or spread the mixture into a lined tart pan (9") and cover with weights. Preheat oven to 190C
4.  Bake for 20 minutes or until just golden brown on top. Remove weights and bake for a further 5 minutes to brown the surface.

**Assembly**

1. Once the tart crust has cooled, spread with a thin layer of melted chocolate to avoid the crust softening from the pastry cream
2. Harden in the fridge for 10 minutes
3. Spread the chilled pastry cream over the tart evenly
4. Arrange fruit over the tart surface
5. If desired, melt together apple jelly and water for 20 seconds and stir well. Use a pastry brush to appply to the surface of the fruit
6. Store in the fridge.
