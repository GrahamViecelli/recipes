# Lemonade Scones

> This is a simple scones recipe that makes fluffy sweet scones with minimal fuss.

## Ingredients

- Flour | 2 cups | 
- Baking Powder | 1 tsp | 
- Sugar | 1 cup | Castor
- Cream | 1/2 cup | Thickened
- Sparkling water | 1/2 cup | Very fizzy

Mix together all ingredients in a bowl. It should be a stiff tacky dough. Pull out onto a flat bench and flatten to about 2cm thick. Thicker makes taller scones.

Rinse a glass cup with water and while still wet cut out circles of dough and place touching onto a baking tray lined with baking paper.

Using a teaspoon moisten the tops of the scones with milk. Try to saturate the top without any excess on the tray. Scatter raw sugar over the tops for a crispy finish.

Bake at 200 for 20 minutes.
